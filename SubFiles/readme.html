    <h3>I love coding and it's my passion!</h3>
    <p>Born in SÃ£o Paulo, I have been coding for 12 years now and it has become my true passion. I dream of turning my passion into a profession. Apart from coding, I also enjoy playing soccer and creating intricate Origamis. Spending quality time with my family is also something that brings me joy!</p>
    <h2>My Coding Skills</h2>
    <p>I have acquired a good amount of knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am proficient in scratch coding. Additionally, I have a basic understanding of Python, and my future aspiration is to master C++ or C#. Coding is my way of expressing creativity and problem-solving.</p>
    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>Hey there! Welcome to this website that pays homage to the classic Macintosh interface using pure HTML. The initial idea for this design was inspired by <a href="https://mattos-1.webflow.io">Matthew P Munger</a>, who gave it a more Macintosh look. The design has been adapted here, and I hope you enjoy exploring the upper bar, the desktop icons, and even the Trash Bin! Special thanks to Matt and ChatGPT for providing valuable code corrections!</p>
